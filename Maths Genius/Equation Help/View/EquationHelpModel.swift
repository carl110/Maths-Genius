If the unit in the second row is larger than the unit in the secon row you will need to \"borrow\" from the tens number in the first row.\nSo cross out the tens number and write the new tens number which is 1 less. And add the 1 from the tens to the unit to show a 2 digit number. Now subtract the second number unit from the new number in the first number units and write the number below the line",
