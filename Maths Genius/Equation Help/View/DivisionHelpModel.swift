                                "Now we have the equations written in a Long Division Bracket, lets start by looking at the largest place value on the dividend.\nHere we will multiply the divisor until it equals the largest place value number in the dividend, or you have multiplied as many times as you can before the divisor is larger than the largest place value number in the dividend.",
                                "Now the number you used to multiply the divisor by can be placed above the Long Division Bracket, in the same place value location as the place value of the dividend digit you were working with.\nTake the largest number you were able to multiply the divisor to and minus that from the place value number in the dividend you were working with.\nPlace this number in the place value position below the Long Division Bracket and place the next place value number to the right, in the Dividend, next to it to create a new equation.",
                                "You now repeat the above steps with the new equation, first see how many times can you multiple the divisor to either equal the new number, or the largest number before the multiplication is larger than the new equation",
                                "Now place the number used to multiply the divisor above the original equation in the next place value position\n",
                                "This can all be written in one column, putting each new equation below the last, lining up the place value positions as you go.\n This can help you retrace your workings if the answer is wrong.",
                                "This method can be used on larger equations, as shown below.\nRemeber to start with the largest place value of the dividend and multiply the divisor, then use the outcome to work out the next part of the equation."]
